# UniquePlanners.Angular

The Unique Planners application is a comprehensive solution developed to serve a local shop specializing in selling a wide range of planners, including daily, weekly, wedding, fitness, and student planners.

The application consists of a user-friendly web app that provides information about the Unique Planners shop. It showcases the available planner types and displays various designs for each type, allowing customers to explore and choose from a diverse selection. Additionally, the web app offers valuable details on purchasing procedures and directions to the physical shop location.
